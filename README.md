# MyRSA
An implementation of the RSA public key encryption algorithm. Just some
fun solving the key exchange problem.

### Dependencies and Getting started
This repository requires openSSL to be installed, and linked in such a
way that the compiler can find it (see this articles on [medium](https://medium.com/@timmykko/using-openssl-library-with-macos-sierra-7807cfd47892)).
I use the clang compiler in my Makefile, so make sure clang is installed as well.

TODO: add instructions for use
