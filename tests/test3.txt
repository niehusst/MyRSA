GERTRUDE OF WYOMING. PART I.

  I.

  On Susquehana’s side, fair Wyoming!
  Although the wild-flower on thy ruined wall
  And roofless homes, a sad remembrance bring
  Of what thy gentle people did befall;
  Yet thou wert once the loveliest land of all
  That see the Atlantic wave their morn restore.
  Sweet land! may I thy lost delights recall,
  And paint thy Gertrude in her bowers of yore,
  Whose beauty was the love of Pennsylvania’s shore!

  II.

  Delightful Wyoming! beneath thy skies,
  The happy shepherd swains had nought to do
  But feed their flocks on green declivities,
  Or skim perchance thy lake with light canoe,
  From morn till evening’s sweeter pastime grew,
  With timbrel, when beneath the forests brown,
  Thy lovely maidens would the dance renew;
  And aye those sunny mountains half-way down
  Would echo flageolet from some romantic town.

  III.

  Then, where of Indian hills the daylight takes
  His leave, how might you the flamingo see
  Disporting like a meteor on the lakes—
  And playful squirrel on his nut-grown tree:
  And every sound of life was full of glee,
  From merry mock-bird’s song,[29] or hum of men;
  While hearkening, fearing nought their revelry,
  The wild-deer arched his neck from glades, and then
  Unhunted, sought his woods and wilderness again.

  IV.

  And scarce had Wyoming of war or crime
  Heard, but in transatlantic story rung,
  For here the exile met from every clime,
  And spoke in friendship every distant tongue:
  Men from the blood of warring Europe sprung,
  Were but divided by the running brook;
  And happy where no Rhenish trumpet sung,
  On plains no sieging mine’s volcano shook,
  The blue-eyed German changed his sword to pruning-hook.

  V.

  Nor far some Andalusian saraband
  Would sound to many a native roundelay—
  But who is he that yet a dearer land
  Remembers over hills and far away?
  Green Albin![30] what though he no more survey
  Thy ships at anchor on the quiet shore,
  Thy pellochs[31] rolling from the mountain bay,
  Thy lone sepulchral cairn upon the moor,
  And distant isles that hear the loud Corbrechtan roar![32]

  VI.

  Alas! poor Caledonia’s mountaineer,
  That want’s stern edict e’er, and feudal grief,
  Had forced him from a home he loved so dear!
  Yet found he here a home, and glad relief,
  And plied the beverage from his own fair sheaf,
  That fired his Highland blood with mickle glee:
  And England sent her men, of men the chief,
  Who taught those sires of Empire yet to be,
  To plant the tree of life,—to plant fair Freedom’s tree!

  VII.

  Here was not mingled in the city’s pomp
  Of life’s extremes the grandeur and the gloom;
  Judgment awoke not here her dismal tromp,
  Nor sealed in blood a fellow-creature’s doom,
  Nor mourned the captive in a living tomb.
  One venerable man, beloved of all,
  Sufficed, where innocence was yet in bloom,
  To sway the strife, that seldom might befall:
  And Albert was their judge in patriarchal hall.

  VIII.

  How reverend was the look, serenely aged,
  He bore, this gentle Pennsylvanian sire,
  Where all but kindly fervours were assuaged,
  Undimmed by weakness’ shade, or turbid ire!
  And though, amidst the calm of thought entire,
  Some high and haughty features might betray
  A soul impetuous once, ’twas earthly fire
  That fled composure’s intellectual ray,
  As Etna’s fires grow dim before the rising day.

  IX.

  I boast no song in magic wonders rife,
  But yet, oh, Nature! is there nought to prize,
  Familiar in thy bosom scenes of life?
  And dwells in daylight truth’s salubrious skies
  No form with which the soul may sympathise?—
  Young, innocent, on whose sweet forehead mild
  The parted ringlet shone in simplest guise,
  An inmate in the home of Albert smiled,
  Or blest his noonday walk—she was his only child.

  X.

  The rose of England bloomed on Gertrude’s cheek—
  What though these shades had seen her birth, her sire
  A Briton’s independence taught to seek
  Far western worlds; and there his household fire
  The light of social love did long inspire,
  And many a halcyon day he lived to see
  Unbroken but by one misfortune dire,
  When fate had reft his mutual heart—but she
  Was gone—and Gertrude climbed a widowed father’s knee.

  XI.

  A loved bequest,—and I may half impart—
  To them that feel the strong paternal tie,
  How like a new existence to his heart
  That living flower uprose beneath his eye,
  Dear as she was from cherub infancy,
  From hours when she would round his garden play,
  To time when as the ripening years went by,
  Her lovely mind could culture well repay,
  And more engaging grew; from pleasing day to day.

  XII.

  I may not paint those thousand infant charms;
  (Unconscious fascination, undesigned!)
  The orison repeated in his arms,
  For God to bless her sire and all mankind;
  The book, the bosom on his knee reclined,
  Or how sweet fairy-lore he heard her con,
  (The playmate ere the teacher of her mind:)
  All uncompanioned else her heart had gone
  Till now, in Gertrude’s eyes, their ninth blue summer shone.

  XIII.

  And summer was the tide, and sweet the hour,
  When sire and daughter saw, with fleet descent,
  An Indian from his bark approach their bower,
  Of buskined limb, and swarthy lineament;[33]
  The red wild feathers on his brow were blent,
  And bracelets bound the arm that helped to light
  A boy, who seemed, as he beside him went,
  Of Christian vesture, and complexion bright,
  Led by his dusky guide, like morning brought by night.

  XIV.

  Yet pensive seemed the boy for one so young—
  The dimple from his polished cheek had fled;
  When, leaning on his forest-bow unstrung,
  The Oneyda warrior to the planter said,
  And laid his hand upon the stripling’s head,
  “Peace be to thee! my words this belt[34] approve;
  The paths of peace my steps have hither led:[33]
  This little nursling, take him to thy love,
  And shield the bird unfledged, since gone the parent dove.

  XV.

  “Christian! I am the foeman of thy foe;
  Our wampum league thy brethren did embrace:[33]
  Upon the Michigan, three moons ago,
  We launched our pirogues for the bison chase,
  And with the Hurons planted for a space,
  With true and faithful hands, the olive-stalk;
  But snakes are in the bosoms of their race,
  And though they held with us a friendly talk,
  The hollow peace-tree fell beneath their tomahawk.

  XVI.

  “It was encamping on the lake’s far port,
  A cry of Areouski[35] broke our sleep,
  Where stormed an ambushed foe thy nation’s fort,
  And rapid, rapid whoops came o’er the deep;
  But long thy country’s war-sign on the steep
  Appeared through ghastly intervals of light,
  And deathfully their thunders seemed to sweep,
  Till utter darkness swallowed up the sight,
  As if a shower of blood had quenched the fiery fight.

  XVII.

  “It slept—it rose again—on high their tower
  Sprung upwards like a torch to light the skies
  Then down again it rained an ember shower,
  And louder lamentations heard we rise:
  As when the evil Manitou[36] that dries
  The Ohio woods, consumes them in his ire,
  In vain the desolated panther flies,
  And howls amidst his wilderness of fire:
  Alas! too late, we reached and smote those Hurons dire!

  XVIII.

  “But as the fox beneath the nobler hound,
  So died their warriors by our battle-brand;
  And from the tree we, with her child, unbound
  A lonely mother of the Christian land:—
  Her lord—the captain of the British band—
  Amidst the slaughter of his soldiers lay.
  Scarce knew the widow our delivering hand;
  Upon her child she sobbed, and swooned away,
  Or shrieked unto the God to whom the Christians pray.

  XIX.

  “Our virgins fed her with their kindly bowls
  Of fever-balm and sweet sagamité:[37]
  But she was journeying to the land of souls,
  And lifted up her dying head to pray
  That we should bid an ancient friend convey
  Her orphan to his home of England’s shore;—
  And take, she said, this token far away,
  To one that will remember us of yore,
  When he beholds the ring that Waldegrave’s Julia wore.

  XX.

  “And I, the eagle of my tribe,[38] have rushed
  With this lorn dove.”—A sage’s self-command
  Had quelled the tears from Albert’s heart that gushed;
  But yet his cheek—his agitated hand—
  That showered upon the stranger of the land
  No common boon, in grief but ill beguiled
  A soul that was not wont to be unmanned;
  “And stay,” he cried, “dear pilgrim of the wild,
  Preserver of my old, my boon companion’s child!—

  XXI.

  “Child of a race whose name my bosom warms,
  On earth’s remotest bounds how welcome here?
  Whose mother oft, a child, has filled these arms,
  Young as thyself, and innocently dear,
  Whose grandsire was my early life’s compeer.
  Ah, happiest home of England’s happy clime!
  How beautiful e’en now thy scenes appear,
  As in the noon and sunshine of my prime!
  How gone like yesterday these thrice ten years of time!

  XXII.

  “And, Julia! when thou wert like Gertrude now,
  Can I forget thee, favourite child of yore?
  Or thought I, in thy father’s house, when thou
  Wert lightest hearted on his festive floor,
  And first of all at his hospitable door
  To meet and kiss me at my journey’s end?
  But where was I when Waldegrave was no more?
  And thou didst pale thy gentle head extend
  In woes, that e’en the tribe of deserts was thy friend?”

  XXIII.

  He said—and strained unto his heart the boy;—
  Far differently, the mute Oneyda took[39]
  His calumet of peace, and cup of joy;[40]
  As monumental bronze unchanged his look;
  A soul that pity touched, but never shook;
  Trained from his tree-rocked cradle[41] to his bier
  The fierce extremes of good and ill to brook
  Impassive[39]—fearing but the shame of fear—
  A stoic of the woods—a man without a tear.

  XXIV.

  Yet deem not goodness on the savage stock
  Of Outalissi’s heart disdained to grow;
  As lives the oak unwithered on the rock
  By storms above, and barrenness below;
  He scorned his own, who felt another’s woe:
  And ere the wolf-skin on his back he flung,
  Or laced his moccasins,[42] in act to go,
  A song of parting to the boy he sung,
  Who slept on Albert’s couch, nor heard his friendly tongue.

  XXV.

  “Sleep, wearied one! and in the dreaming land
  Shouldst thou to-morrow with thy mother meet.[39]
  Oh! tell her spirit, that the white man’s hand
  Hath plucked the thorns of sorrow from thy feet;
  While I in lonely wilderness shall greet
  Thy little foot-prints—or by traces know
  The fountain, where at noon I thought it sweet
  To feed thee with the quarry of my bow,
  And poured the lotus-horn,[43] or slew the mountain roe.

  XXVI.

  “Adieu! sweet scion of the rising sun!
  But should affliction’s storms thy blossom mock
  Then come again—my own adopted one!
  And I will graft thee on a noble stock:
  The crocodile, the condor of the rock,[44]
  Shall be the pastime of thy sylvan wars;
  And I will teach thee, in the battle’s shock,
  To pay with Huron blood thy father’s scars,
  And gratulate his soul rejoicing in the stars!”

  XXVII.

  So finished he the rhyme (howe’er uncouth)
  That true to nature’s fervid feelings ran;
  (And song is but the eloquence of truth:)
  Then forth uprose that lone way-faring man;[44]
  But dauntless he, nor chart, nor journey’s plan
  In woods required, whose trainèd eye was keen
  As eagle of the wilderness, to scan
  His path, by mountain, swamp, or deep ravine,
  Or ken far friendly huts on good savannahs green.

  XXVIII.

  Old Albert saw him from the valley’s side—
  His pirogue launched—his pilgrimage begun—
  Far, like the red-bird’s wing he seemed to glide;
  Then dived, and vanished in the woodlands dun.
  Oft, to that spot by tender memory won,
  Would Albert climb the promontory’s height,
  If but a dim sail glimmered in the sun;
  But never more, to bless his longing sight,
  Was Outalissi hailed, with bark and plumage bright.

GERTRUDE OF WYOMING. PART II.

  I.

  A valley from the river shore withdrawn
  Was Albert’s home, two quiet woods between,
  Whose lofty verdure overlooked his lawn;
  And waters to their resting-place serene
  Came freshening, and reflecting all the scene:
  (A mirror in the depth of flowery shelves;)
  So sweet a spot of earth, you might (I ween)
  Have guessed some congregation of the elves,
  To sport by summer moons, had shaped it for themselves.

  II.

  Yet wanted not the eye far scope to muse,
  Nor vistas opened by the wandering stream;
  Both were at evening Allegany views
  Through ridges burning in her western beam,
  Lake after lake interminably gleam:
  And past those settlers’ haunts the eye might roam
  Where earth’s unliving silence all would seem;
  Save where on rocks the beaver built his dome,
  Or buffalo remote lowed far from human home.

  III.

  But silent not that adverse eastern path,
  Which saw Aurora’s hills the horizon crown;
  There was the river heard, in bed of wrath
  (A precipice of foam from mountains brown),
  Like tumults heard from some far distant town;
  But softening in approach he left his gloom,
  And murmured pleasantly, and laid him down
  To kiss those easy curving banks of bloom,
  That lent the windward air an exquisite perfume.

  IV.

  It seemed as if those scenes sweet influence had
  On Gertrude’s soul, and kindness like their own
  Inspired those eyes affectionate and glad,
  That seemed to love whate’er they looked upon
  Whether with Hebe’s mirth her features shone,
  Or if a shade more pleasing them o’ercast,
  (As if for heavenly musing meant alone;)
  Yet so becomingly the expression past,
  That each succeeding look was lovelier than the last.

  V.

  Nor, guess I, was that Pennsylvanian home,
  With all its picturesque and balmy grace,
  And fields that were a luxury to roam,
  Lost on the soul that looked from such a face!
  Enthusiast of the woods! when years apace
  Had bound thy lovely waist with woman’s zone,
  The sunrise path, at morn, I see thee trace
  To hills with high magnolia overgrown,
  And joy to breathe the groves, romantic and alone.

  VI.

  The sunrise drew her thoughts to Europe forth,
  That thus apostrophised its viewless scene:
  “Land of my father’s love, my mother’s birth!
  The home of kindred I have never seen!
  We know not other—oceans are between:
  Yet say! far friendly hearts, from whence we came,
  Of us does oft remembrance intervene?
  My mother sure—my sire a thought may claim;—
  But Gertrude is to you an unregarded name.

  VII.

  “And yet, loved England! when thy name I trace
  In many a pilgrim’s tale and poet’s song,
  How can I choose but wish for one embrace
  Of them, the dear unknown, to whom belong
  My mother’s looks,—perhaps her likeness strong?
  Oh, parent! with what reverential awe,
  From features of thine own related throng,
  An image of thy face my soul could draw!
  And see thee once again whom I too shortly saw!”

  VIII.

  Yet deem not Gertrude sighed for foreign joy;
  To soothe a father’s couch her only care,
  And keep his reverend head from all annoy:
  For this, methinks, her homeward steps repair,
  Soon as the morning wreath had bound her hair;
  While yet the wild deer trod in spangling dew,
  While boatmen carolled to the fresh-blown air,
  And woods a horizontal shadow threw,
  And early fox appeared in momentary view.

  IX.

  Apart there was a deep untrodden grot,
  Where oft the reading hours sweet Gertrude wore.
  Tradition had not named its lonely spot;
  But here (methinks) might India’s sons explore
  Their fathers’ dust,[45] or lift, perchance of yore,
  Their voice to the great Spirit:—rocks sublime
  To human art a sportive semblance bore,
  And yellow lichens coloured all the clime,
  Like moonlight battlements, and towers decayed by time.

  X.

  But high in amphitheatre above,
  His arms the everlasting aloes threw:
  Breathed but an air of heaven, and all the grove
  As if with instinct living spirit grew,
  Rolling its verdant gulfs of every hue;
  And now suspended was the pleasing din,
  Now from a murmur faint it swelled anew,
  Like the first note of organ heard within
  Cathedral aisles,—ere yet its symphony begin.

  XI.

  It was in this lone valley she would charm
  The lingering noon, where flowers a couch had strewn;
  Her cheek reclining, and her snowy arm
  On hillock by the palm-tree half o’ergrown:
  And aye that volume on her lap is thrown,
  Which every heart of human mould endears;
  With Shakespeare’s self she speaks and smiles alone,
  And no intruding visitation fears,
  To shame the unconscious laugh, or stop her sweetest tears.

  XII.

  And nought within the grove was heard or seen
  But stock-doves ’plaining through its gloom profound,
  Or winglet of the fairy humming bird,
  Like atoms of the rainbow fluttering round;
  When, lo! there entered to its inmost ground
  A youth, the stranger of a distant land;
  He was, to wit, for eastern mountains bound;
  But late the equator suns his cheek had tanned,
  And California’s gales his roving bosom fanned.

  XIII.

  A steed, whose rein hung loosely o’er his arm,
  He led dismounted; ere his leisure pace,
  Amid the brown leaves, could her ear alarm,
  Close he had come, and worshipped for a space
  Those downcast features:—she her lovely face
  Uplift on one, whose lineaments and frame
  Were youth and manhood’s intermingled grace:
  Iberian seemed his boot—his robe the same,
  And well the Spanish plume his lofty looks became.

  XIV.

  For Albert’s home he sought—her finger fair
  Has pointed where the father’s mansion stood.
  Returning from the copse he soon was there
  And soon has Gertrude hied from dark green wood
  Nor joyless, by the converse, understood
  Between the man of age and pilgrim young
  That gay congeniality of mood,
  And early liking from acquaintance sprung;
  Full fluently conversed their guest in England’s tongue.

  XV.

  And well could he his pilgrimage of taste
  Unfold,—and much they loved his fervid strain,
  While he each fair variety retraced
  Of climes, and manners, o’er the eastern main.
  Now happy Switzer’s hills,—romantic Spain,—
  Gay lilied fields of France,—or, more refined,
  The soft Ausonia’s monumental reign;
  Nor less each rural image he designed
  Than all the city’s pomp and home of human kind.
