GERTRUDE OF WYOMING. PART I.

  I.

  On Susquehana’s side, fair Wyoming!
  Although the wild-flower on thy ruined wall
  And roofless homes, a sad remembrance bring
  Of what thy gentle people did befall;
  Yet thou wert once the loveliest land of all
  That see the Atlantic wave their morn restore.
  Sweet land! may I thy lost delights recall,
  And paint thy Gertrude in her bowers of yore,
  Whose beauty was the love of Pennsylvania’s shore!

  II.

  Delightful Wyoming! beneath thy skies,
  The happy shepherd swains had nought to do
  But feed their flocks on green declivities,
  Or skim perchance thy lake with light canoe,
  From morn till evening’s sweeter pastime grew,
  With timbrel, when beneath the forests brown,
  Thy lovely maidens would the dance renew;
  And aye those sunny mountains half-way down
  Would echo flageolet from some romantic town.

  III.

  Then, where of Indian hills the daylight takes
  His leave, how might you the flamingo see
  Disporting like a meteor on the lakes—
  And playful squirrel on his nut-grown tree:
  And every sound of life was full of glee,
  From merry mock-bird’s song,[29] or hum of men;
  While hearkening, fearing nought their revelry,
  The wild-deer arched his neck from glades, and then
  Unhunted, sought his woods and wilderness again.

  IV.

  And scarce had Wyoming of war or crime
  Heard, but in transatlantic story rung,
  For here the exile met from every clime,
  And spoke in friendship every distant tongue:
  Men from the blood of warring Europe sprung,
  Were but divided by the running brook;
  And happy where no Rhenish trumpet sung,
  On plains no sieging mine’s volcano shook,
  The blue-eyed German changed his sword to pruning-hook.

  V.

  Nor far some Andalusian saraband
  Would sound to many a native roundelay—
  But who is he that yet a dearer land
  Remembers over hills and far away?
  Green Albin![30] what though he no more survey
  Thy ships at anchor on the quiet shore,
  Thy pellochs[31] rolling from the mountain bay,
  Thy lone sepulchral cairn upon the moor,
  And distant isles that hear the loud Corbrechtan roar![32]

  VI.

  Alas! poor Caledonia’s mountaineer,
  That want’s stern edict e’er, and feudal grief,
  Had forced him from a home he loved so dear!
  Yet found he here a home, and glad relief,
  And plied the beverage from his own fair sheaf,
  That fired his Highland blood with mickle glee:
  And England sent her men, of men the chief,
  Who taught those sires of Empire yet to be,
  To plant the tree of life,—to plant fair Freedom’s tree!

  VII.

  Here was not mingled in the city’s pomp
  Of life’s extremes the grandeur and the gloom;
  Judgment awoke not here her dismal tromp,
  Nor sealed in blood a fellow-creature’s doom,
  Nor mourned the captive in a living tomb.
  One venerable man, beloved of all,
  Sufficed, where innocence was yet in bloom,
  To sway the strife, that seldom might befall:
  And Albert was their judge in patriarchal hall.

  VIII.

  How reverend was the look, serenely aged,
  He bore, this gentle Pennsylvanian sire,
  Where all but kindly fervours were assuaged,
  Undimmed by weakness’ shade, or turbid ire!
  And though, amidst the calm of thought entire,
  Some high and haughty features might betray
  A soul impetuous once, ’twas earthly fire
  That fled composure’s intellectual ray,
  As Etna’s fires grow dim before the rising day.

  IX.

  I boast no song in magic wonders rife,
  But yet, oh, Nature! is there nought to prize,
  Familiar in thy bosom scenes of life?
  And dwells in daylight truth’s salubrious skies
  No form with which the soul may sympathise?—
  Young, innocent, on whose sweet forehead mild
  The parted ringlet shone in simplest guise,
  An inmate in the home of Albert smiled,
  Or blest his noonday walk—she was his only child.

  X.

  The rose of England bloomed on Gertrude’s cheek—
  What though these shades had seen her birth, her sire
  A Briton’s independence taught to seek
  Far western worlds; and there his household fire
  The light of social love did long inspire,
  And many a halcyon day he lived to see
  Unbroken but by one misfortune dire,
  When fate had reft his mutual heart—but she
  Was gone—and Gertrude climbed a widowed father’s knee.

  XI.

  A loved bequest,—and I may half impart—
  To them that feel the strong paternal tie,
  How like a new existence to his heart
  That living flower uprose beneath his eye,
  Dear as she was from cherub infancy,
  From hours when she would round his garden play,
  To time when as the ripening years went by,
  Her lovely mind could culture well repay,
  And more engaging grew; from pleasing day to day.

  XII.

  I may not paint those thousand infant charms;
  (Unconscious fascination, undesigned!)
  The orison repeated in his arms,
  For God to bless her sire and all mankind;
  The book, the bosom on his knee reclined,
  Or how sweet fairy-lore he heard her con,
  (The playmate ere the teacher of her mind:)
  All uncompanioned else her heart had gone
  Till now, in Gertrude’s eyes, their ninth blue summer shone.

  XIII.

  And summer was the tide, and sweet the hour,
  When sire and daughter saw, with fleet descent,
  An Indian from his bark approach their bower,
  Of buskined limb, and swarthy lineament;[33]
  The red wild feathers on his brow were blent,
  And bracelets bound the arm that helped to light
  A boy, who seemed, as he beside him went,
  Of Christian vesture, and complexion bright,
  Led by his dusky guide, like morning brought by night.

  XIV.

  Yet pensive seemed the boy for one so young—
  The dimple from his polished cheek had fled;
  When, leaning on his forest-bow unstrung,
  The Oneyda warrior to the planter said,
  And laid his hand upon the stripling’s head,
  “Peace be to thee! my words this belt[34] approve;
  The paths of peace my steps have hither led:[33]
  This little nursling, take him to thy love,
  And shield the bird unfledged, since gone the parent dove.

  XV.

  “Christian! I am the foeman of thy foe;
  Our wampum league thy brethren did embrace:[33]
  Upon the Michigan, three moons ago,
  We launched our pirogues for the bison chase,
  And with the Hurons planted for a space,
  With true and faithful hands, the olive-stalk;
  But snakes are in the bosoms of their race,
  And though they held with us a friendly talk,
  The hollow peace-tree fell beneath their tomahawk.

  XVI.

  “It was encamping on the lake’s far port,
  A cry of Areouski[35] broke our sleep,
  Where stormed an ambushed foe thy nation’s fort,
  And rapid, rapid whoops came o’er the deep;
  But long thy country’s war-sign on the steep
  Appeared through ghastly intervals of light,
  And deathfully their thunders seemed to sweep,
  Till utter darkness swallowed up the sight,
  As if a shower of blood had quenched the fiery fight.

  XVII.

  “It slept—it rose again—on high their tower
  Sprung upwards like a torch to light the skies
  Then down again it rained an ember shower,
  And louder lamentations heard we rise:
  As when the evil Manitou[36] that dries
  The Ohio woods, consumes them in his ire,
  In vain the desolated panther flies,
  And howls amidst his wilderness of fire:
  Alas! too late, we reached and smote those Hurons dire!
